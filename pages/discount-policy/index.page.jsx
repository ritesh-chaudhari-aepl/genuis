            We understand that, occasionally, situations may arise where a
            client may request a Discount for the work that has been provided.
            We strive to maintain a fair and transparent approach to resolving
            such matters. This Discount policy outlines terms and conditions for
            requesting a Discount as a client for services provided. Please
            carefully review the following information.
          </p>

            The client is eligible for a Full/Partial/No Discount based on
            conditions mentioned below:
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl  text-[darkblue] py-2">

          <p className="">
            A full Discount can be requested under the following cases:
          </p>
          <div className="px-16">
            <ul>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                If the delivered assignment does not meet the agreed-upon
                specifications and requirements outlined in the initial
                assignment description or instructions provided.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                If the assignment fails to be delivered within the agreed-upon
                deadline.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl  text-[darkblue] py-2">
            Partial Discount
          </h3>
          <p className="">
            A Partial Discount can be requested under the following cases:
          </p>
          <div className="px-16">
            <ul>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                If the client decides to cancel the task before the deadline, a
                cancellation charge of 25% will be applied if the expert has not
                started the work. However, if the expert has started the work,
                an additional amount will be charged based on the percentage of
                work completed by the expert.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                If the client receives a low score on the assignment, the client
                is entitled to a partial Discount of up to 30%, depending on how
                much lower than the agreed-upon marks the client has received.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl  text-[darkblue] py-2">
            No Discount
          </h3>
          <p className="">
            No Discount will be provided to the client under the following
            cases:
          </p>
          <div className="px-16">
            <ul>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                The request for a Discount is made more than 30 days after the
                task delivery.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                If the client has already approved and accepted the task.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                The client has used the delivered work or a portion of it for
                their intended purposes.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                In case the client feels that certain contents of the assignment
                contain plagiarism, then we will revise the assignment to clear
                out any plagiarized content as pointed out by the client until
                the clientâ€™s satisfaction free of cost. Since all the
                assignments are checked through various plagiarism-finding tools
                to bring plagiarism below the agreed-upon limit before they are
                dispatched to the client, we will not Discount the money in
                these cases.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                In case the full payment for a task is done and the client
                decides to cancel the task, no Discount will be provided to the
                client if no expert has been assigned. However, the client can
                get any other work of the same monetary value done without any
                additional cost.
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                If a task is delayed due to a last-minute change requested by
                the client.

              <li className="list-disc font-Inter py-2">
                We aim to provide the best solutions for the assignments, and
                that&apos;s why we will keep reworking on the assignment until
                the client is satisfied that the assignment meets the
                requirements. However, the reworks are done within one month (30
                days) of the time frame. Any rework requested after 30 days of
                task delivery will be treated as a new task, and no Discount
                will be provided for the said original task.
